Description: CYPRESS is an Cell Type specific power tool. This package aims to 
  perform power analysis for the cell type-specific data. It calculates FDR, 
  FDC,and power, under various study design parameters, including but not
  limited   to sample size, and effect size.  It takes the input of the 
  SummarizeExperimental(SE) object with observed mixture data (feature by 
  sample matrix), and the cell type mixture proportions (sample by cell type 
  matrix).  It can solve the cell type mixture proportions from the reference
  free panel from TOAST and conduct  tests to identify cell-type-specific 
  differential expression (csDE) genes.
